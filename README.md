# pyDM

Python - Gatan Microscopy Suite interface

For Digital Micrograph 2.0+ 
(there is a version for 1.7

Requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and the Gatan API ver. 2. Builds a plugin that must be placed into the 
Gatan Digital Micrograph plugins folder, and a .pyd file which may be loaded as a Python module.  Data is 
transferred between the two softwares by a shared mapped memory region. For many image dimensions this plugin 
is faster than acquisition within Digital Micrograph with the proprietary .s scripting interface.
